# ethereum-mesh

Byzantium Linux provides a great foundation for building distributed applications, as simple-to-use "ad-hoc wireless mesh networking for the zombie apocalypse." Ethereum-mesh will integrate Ethereum into Byzantium and expose blockchain-based social networking functionality through a browser interface. Controls will include currency, reputation system, and a merit-based heterarchical system for project collaboration.
